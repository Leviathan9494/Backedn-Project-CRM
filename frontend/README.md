PRM - Product Relation Management (Frontend)

This is a small React + Vite frontend that talks to the backend at http://localhost:8000

Requirements
- Bun (optional) or Node.js + npm/yarn

Install Bun
1. Install Bun (https://bun.sh/) â€” e.g. run the official install script:

   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

2. Open a new terminal so `bun` is on your PATH.

Run (with Bun)
- From the `frontend` folder:

   bun install
   bun dev

Run (with npm)
- From the `frontend` folder:

   npm install
   npm run dev

Notes
- The frontend assumes the backend Swagger UI is available at http://localhost:8000/swagger and the API at http://localhost:8000.
- ID fields are auto-generated by the backend and are displayed read-only in the table.
